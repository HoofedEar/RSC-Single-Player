# RSC Single Player
RSC Single Player is a standalone single player RSC reproduction and sandbox. The application handles itself entirely and does not rely on a local server nor database.
  
For the original repo, releases, etc. please go here: https://github.com/sean-niemann/RSC-Single-Player

This repo is a fork that looks to continue the work of Sean and update the project to be as accurate as it possibly can be. And maybe in the future, allow for custom content.
